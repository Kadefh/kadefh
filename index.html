								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/profile.jpg"  alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am an Australian citizen.</p>
								<p>My hobbies include cooking, playing video games, I play basketball on Monday nights and mixed netball on Thursday nights, watching NBA and AFL and going to the gym.</p>
								<p>I have two dogs, the oldest is a female long-haired German shepherd named Storm, the youngest, a male golden retriever named Alby.</p>
								<p>I believe my interest in Information Technology (IT) began when I first started to study VET IT when I was in year 11 & 12. I enjoyed learning the basics of programming and the history of technology and how far it's come. Recently I went on my first overseas trip with some of my family to Vietnam, my cousin Jesse being one of them. He recently completed his degree in software engineering at RMIT. Listening to him talk about his experiences with his time at university, what he does for work now and his aspects of what the future holds for technology I found to be fascinating, which gave me drive to want to pursue a career in IT.</p>
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT for a few reasons. RMIT has quite a high university ranking on Open universities, the highest-ranking for a university that has an Information Technology course. RMIT's Information Technology course also had quite a number of core subjects and electives that I would be interested in completing. Lastly, my cousin Jesse completed his degree in software engineering at RMIT. He highly recommended RMIT explaining his experiences there and what he learnt completing his degree.</p>
								<p>I expect I'll learn a great deal about programming, being that I'm still quite new to writing code and only knowing a few basics, learn a great deal about modern technologies such as cloud-based storage, databases, and security, as well as 'soft skills' that are expected in a professional workplace such as communication and teamwork.</p>

						<!-- Personality Tests -->
							<article id="Testing">
								<h2 class="major">Testing</h2>
								<p>I found the results of my 3 personality tests (Fisher Temperament Inventory Test, Big 5 Personality test and the Myers-Briggs test) to be both surprising in some areas and fitting in others. For example, I agree with the Fisher Temperament Inventory test result that I am cautious. I tend to over-analyse everything I see, hear or work on. This is due to my drive for self-success and how highly I value impressing others. An example of this would be in my cooking. When I have friends and family over for dinner, I am very cautious that I can cater correctly for everyone. I agree that I’m very conscientious; I like to think that I am very organised and take pride in the work that I carry out. Although, this can sometimes impact my ability to complete other necessary tasks in my life, such as maintaining my lawn and garden. This is due to dedicating too much time to tasks that I highly value, such as university. I disagree however with my low score of Neuroticism. I am quite passionate about the things that are most important to me and take failure very seriously. An example of this would be my application to the Victoria Police Force before joining RMIT. I nearly made it to the end of the recruitment process and unfortunately fell short after failing the second last stage. I was quite shaken by the result and feel I took it very seriously, which is why I think my score reflects poorly here. I found my result in the Myers-Briggs test to be quite interesting. I felt it clashed with my result in the Big 5 test as I received a result of ENFJ-A. This result specifies that I can over-analyse my feelings and emotions, yet my low score in the Big 5 test with Neuroticism states otherwise. The test also boasts about how charismatic I am, yet I feel like I am more of an introvert. Although, when necessary I can be an augmented extrovert in the right environment, such as when I’m playing basketball or presenting to my work colleagues after a safety meeting. This is perhaps where my charismatic result is stemming from.</p>

								<p>With these results in mind, I would bring an organised and approachable attitude to my team. I would also be able to lead our group wherever I felt necessary and place a great amount of trust in my team to complete their respective tasks and communicate with the group if they are having trouble. However, I may also unintentionally volunteer to take on too much of the workload that I can handle, which could disrupt the group. I may also be sensitive to my ideas and opinions within our project, this could potentially harm the group if someone was to unfairly criticize my thoughts that I bring to the table.</p>

								<p>Taking this into account when forming a team, I would be mindful to keep an open mind when brainstorming ideas for our project, remembering that everyone has their own opinions and ideas and that if some of my ideas and thoughts don’t get chosen to not take it to heart. This is especially the case as I am quite new to university and Information technology (IT) and may be quite inexperienced compared to others. I would also suggest to the group that we evenly distribute the workload of our upcoming assignments to ensure that I don’t take on more than I can handle. Lastly, I need to bear in mind that members of the group may have other subjects, assignments or work commitments going on in their lives which may hold them back from completing tasks as timely as I do. Additionally, if a group member is falling behind and my course work is up to date, I could offer my assistance to help ensure the assignment is completed to a high standard.</p>

						<!-- Job -->
							<article id="Job">
								<h2 class="major">Job</h2>
								<p>An ideal job that I found on seek that I found interesting was a software engineering position for Metro Trains, Melbourne. This job would involve the installation of software to assist tram passengers and staff; helping passengers be connected online while also helping staff with installing software that eliminates the need for paper. This will be carried out using various programming, using Javascript and Java to install the software and to carry it out onto all current platforms. After installation is complete, the software engineer would also need to carry out regular maintenance and troubleshoot intricate problems with the software.</p>
								<p>I find this job interesting because it would be a great opportunity to work on some sizable long-term projects in a team environment. This would enable me to learn on the go even after finishing tertiary studies. I also find this job appealing because of the number of people that would benefit from your hard work every day, especially taking into consideration that almost 100,000 myki travellers have already made the switch to Myki’s smartphone app (Barbaschow, 2019).</p>
								<p>To be successful in my application, I would need to possess a suitable knowledge base using various operating systems when carrying out and troubleshooting the software installation (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android). They would also be expected to have good communication skills as they would be working in a team environment, as well as be accommodating to a fast-paced work environment. The applicant is also expected to have had previous experience in a study or work environment of over 5 years in a software engineering role and experience with Java and Javascript. It also requires experience in using Structured Query Language (SQL).</p>
								<p>Some skills that I think I possess that would be relevant to the role would be; being able to communicate well in a team environment, I have a good knowledge base around the use of Windows, Mac, iOS and Android and have recently begun learning Javascript.</p>
								<p>I am currently studying part-time to achieve a bachelor’s degree in information technology (IT), this will take six years to achieve, assuming I don’t take on full-time studies at any given point. This would give me plenty of opportunities to spend time learning relevant skills that are required for the job. This can be done informally by learning Javascript and SQL through services such as Code Academy or YouTube. I would also take the opportunity to choose electives specific to this role. This could involve choosing electives such as Software Architecture or Software Engineering Fundamentals. Additionally, I could use the lengthy period throughout my studies to pursue a job in IT that doesn’t require as many extensive qualifications and skills to build a foundation for my IT career. This could involve applying for a support technician role at the workplace I’m currently employed at, or perhaps an IT consultant role at another workplace. After attaining a bachelor’s degree in IT, I would then seek out an entry-level position relevant to software engineering and return to tertiary study to work towards a Bachelor of Software Engineering degree.</p>

						<!-- Project -->
							<article id="Project">
								<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
								<p>My idea for an Information Technology (IT) project is to design a mobile application that aims to reduce the wastage of perishable foods such as meats, fruit, vegetables, and dairy, in the form of a recipe app. The idea is that people can have a look at what’s in their fridge, see what foods are about to expire, open the app, enter the items they intend to use, and a recipe will be available for them to use. This app could save households hundreds of dollars on their groceries each year by dramatically reducing the amount of food households throw away.</p>
								<p>Cooking is one of my favourite hobbies. I enjoy experimenting and creating new recipes for my friends and family, which is why I’m excited to do a project such as this. Designing this application gives me an opportunity to not only enjoy creating new recipes that people can enjoy, but also to sharpen my programming skills and deepen my knowledge with different languages such as Python or Javascript.</p>
								<p>My plans for this app would be a large database of perishable ingredients that users will be able to select, which will then be paired to a recipe. These recipes will be put into categorised databases that would help the user pinpoint what they want; such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, vegetarian, vegan, ketogenic, etc. This would simplify the way a user searches for a recipe.</p>
								<p>Once the user has selected the meal they wish to create, the recipe would have a description of the meal they’re making, a serving size calculator to help them with the quantity of ingredients they need, the ingredients required and the method to cook the recipe.</p>
								<p>Some important future features that I would love to have that would set my app apart from the rest of the competition; would be the option for users to create an account with the app so that they may review the recipes and share recipes via social media or text. It would also have detailed, high-quality photos and videos to go with each recipe so that the user has a clear visual on what they’re meant to be doing and how it’s meant to look. I would like to have a ‘Featured recipes’ section for the app, for recipes that are popular among users or recipes that have been received really well in reviews to help users find great tasting recipes. Lastly, I would like to have my app available to as many users as possible, so having the app on iOS, Android and iPad would be key. </p>
								<p>After doing some research, I found that there have been apps created that are like my idea, such as Supercook, BigOven and Epicurious (Larson, 2019). However, I feel like there is plenty of room for improvement. For instance, some apps only allow you to select one ingredient to search for rather than a collection of ingredients, some don’t have all the features I listed earlier, such as a serving size calculator or the ability to share recipes with others, and some apps just aren’t very aesthetically pleasing to use. Therefore, I believe my app would be set apart from the others. This app is a fantastic opportunity for people to cut their grocery expenses by utilising every ingredient they purchase, rather than letting it go to waste.<p/>
								<p>Obviously, this task would be no easy feat. It would require several hundred hours entering ingredients into a database, categorising each of those ingredients into a recipe that will then be categorised into different meal types. There’s also the issue of creating hundreds of different recipes to make sure the users have plenty of meals to choose from. This would need to be handled over time by consistently adding recipes to the app to keep users coming back. Additionally, the features of the app would be a difficult task for someone like me, who has not had any experience with designing an app before, so this would require an understanding of Java and/or Python. It would also be worthwhile learning Swift to have the app on iOS and iPadOS, as well as Android. </p>
								<p>The software I need to create my app would be some software development tools such as XCode for iOS and Android studio for Android, version control software such as GitHub to assist in group work when developing the app and updates, photo and video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop to create professional photos and videos of the recipes and possibly cloud storage such as Amazon Cloud for all the content being put onto the app. To set up the databases for my app, I would use open-source database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This will assist me in the storage of my ingredients and recipes and catagorise them. The hardware I would require would be a computer to design the app, an iPhone and Android phone to test the app, possibly a NAS (Network-attached storage) if that was a more viable option opposed to purchasing cloud storage online, and a camera to shoot the photos and videos for the recipes.</p>
								<p>If the project was successful, it would have the opportunity to significantly cut food wastage in households, this would assist in cutting peoples grocery expenses by having a platform to find recipes for ingredients in their fridge that are close to their expiry date. It also has the potential to assist farmers with demands during tough times with draughts, with over $20 billion worth of food being wasted each year in Australia, it would certainly help farmers to have that number significantly reduced (Afshariyan, 2018).</p>
