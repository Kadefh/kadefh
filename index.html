								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/stormAlby.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am an Australian citizen.</p>
								<p>My hobbies include cooking, playing video games, I play basketball on Monday nights and mixed netball on Thursday nights, watching NBA and AFL and going to the gym.</p>
								<p>I have two dogs, the oldest is a female long haired German shepherd named Storm, the youngest, a male golden retriever named Alby.</p>
								<p>I believe my interest in IT began when I first started to study VET IT when I was in year 11 & 12. I enjoyed learning the basics of programming and the history of technology and how far it's come. Recently I went on my first overseas trip with some of my family to Vietnam, My cousin Jesse being one of them. He recently completed his degree in software engineering at RMIT. Listening to him talk about his experiences with his time at university, what he does for work now and his aspects of what the future holds for technology I found to be fascinating, which gave me drive to want to pursue a career in IT.</p>
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT for a few reasons. RMIT has quite a high university ranking on Open universities, the highest-ranking for a university that has an Information Technology course. RMIT's Information Technology course also had quite a number of core subjects and electives that I would be interested in completing. Lastly, my cousin Jesse completed his degree in software engineering at RMIT. He highly recommended RMIT explaining his experiences there and what he learnt completing his degree.</p>
								<p>I expect I'll learn a great deal about programming, being that I'm still quite new to writing code and only knowing a few basics, learn a great deal about modern technologies such as cloud-based storage, databases, and security, as well as 'soft skills' that are expected in a professional workplace such as communication and teamwork.</p>

						<!-- Personality Tests -->
							<article id="Testing">
								<h2 class="major">Testing</h2>
								<p>I found the results of my 3 personality tests (Myers-Briggs, Big 5 Personality test and my online learning style test) to be both surprising in some areas, and fitting in others. I have always thought that I was more of an introvert, but looking further into the answers of the test, I could be have been wrong.</p>
								<p>I think that my results would benefit a team to be geared towards organisation. I enjoy being ahead of time to leave space for when things go wrong so that I can be prepared for those situations. I think this can also leave room for improvement for me when it comes to adaptability. I enjoy adapting to new changes under good organisation. However, sometimes changes can come quickly, it would be beneficial to me to be able to adapt without notice a little easier.</p>
								<p>When forming a team I think I would certainly preference like minded people who are organised and value succeeding as much as I try to. I would also keep in mind when forming a team that some people also prefer to complete tasks as they learn them and spread their time out over the complete timeframe. </p>

							<article id="Job">
								<h2 class="major">Job</h2>
								<p>An ideal job that I found on seek that I found interesting was a software engineering position for Metro Trains, Melbourne.</p>
								<p>This job would involve the installation of software to assist tram passengers and staff; helping passengers be connected online while also helping staff with installing software that eliminates the need for paper. This will be carried out using various programming, using Javascript and Java to install the software and to carry it out onto all current platforms. After installation is complete, the software engineer would also need to carry out regular maintenance and troubleshoot intricate problems with the software.</p>
								<p>I find this job interesting because it would be a great opportunity to work on some sizable long-term projects in a team environment. I also find this job appealing because of the amount of people that would benefit from your hard work every day. </p>
								<p>The successful applicant would need to possess a suitable knowledge base using various operating systems when carrying out and troubleshooting the software installation (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android). They would also be expected to have good communication skills as they would be working in a team environment, as well as be accommodating to a fast-paced work environment. The applicant is also expected to have had previous experience in a study or work environment of over 5 years in a software engineering role and experience with Java, Javascript and SQL.</p>
								<p>Some skills that I think I possess that would be relevant to the role would be; being able to communicate well in a team environment, I have a good knowledge base around the use of Windows, Mac, iOS and Android and have recently started to learn Javascript.</p>
								<p>To achieve this role, I would first concentrate on completing my course at RMIT (Bachelor of Information Technology). Whilst completing my course I would also focus on learning programming languages specific to the role, such as SQL. Additionally, I could also seek out employment or work experience in a software development environment to further increase my knowledge base.</p>

						<!-- Project -->
							<article id="Project">
								<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
								<p>My idea for an IT project is to design a mobile application that aims to reduce the wastage of perishable foods such as meats, fruit, vegetables, and dairy, in the form of a recipe app. The idea is that people can have a look at what’s in their fridge, see what foods are about to expire, open the app, enter the items they intend to use, and a recipe will be available for them to use. This app could save households hundreds of dollars on their groceries each year by dramatically reducing the amount of food households throw away.</p>
								<p>Cooking is one of my favourite hobbies. I enjoy experimenting and creating new recipes for my friends and family, which is why I’m excited to do a project such as this. Earlier this year I started purchasing my food through Hello Fresh. One thing I admire about Hello Fresh is that they deliver the right quantity of the ingredients you’re using so that there is zero wastage. Hello Fresh also has an app where you can order your meals for the week and look at other different recipes they have in their system. Unfortunately, their recipes are catered to their customers only; they don’t list the quantities of each ingredient required for the recipe.</p>
								<p>My plans for this app would be a large database of perishable ingredients that users will be able to select, which will then be paired to a recipe. These recipes will be put into categorised databases that would help the user pinpoint what they want; such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, vegetarian, vegan, ketogenic, etc. This would simplify the way a user searches for a particular recipe.
								Once the user has selected the meal they wish to create, the recipe would have a description of the meal they’re making, a serving size calculator to help them with the quantity of ingredients they need, the ingredients required and the method to cook the recipe.
								Some important future features that I would love to have that would set my app apart from the rest of the competition; would be the option for users to create an account with the app so that they may review the recipes and share recipes via social media or text. It would also have detailed, high-quality photos and videos to go with each recipe so that the user has a clear visual on what they’re meant to be doing and how it’s meant to look. I would like to have a ‘Featured recipes’ section for the app, for recipes that are popular among users or recipes that have been received really well in reviews to help users find great tasting recipes. Lastly, I would like to have my app available to as many users as possible, so having the app on iOS, Android and iPad would be key. 
								After doing some research, I found that there have been apps created that are like my idea. However, I feel like there is plenty of room for improvement. For instance, some apps only allow you to select one ingredient to search for rather than a collection of ingredients, some don’t have all the features I listed earlier, such as a serving size calculator or the ability to share recipes with others, and some apps just aren’t very aesthetically pleasing to use. Therefore, I believe my app would be set apart from the others. This app is a fantastic opportunity for people to cut their grocery expenses by utilising every ingredient they purchase, rather than letting it go to waste.
								Obviously, this task would be no easy feat. It would require several hundred hours entering ingredients into a database, categorising each of those ingredients into a recipe that will then be categorised into different meal types. There’s also the issue of creating hundreds of different recipes to make sure the users have plenty of meals to choose from. This would need to be handled over time by consistently adding recipes to the app to keep users coming back. Additionally, the features of the app would be a difficult task for someone like me, who has not had any experience with designing an app before, so this would require an understanding of Java and/or Python. It would also be worthwhile learning Swift to have the app on iOS and iPadOS, as well as Android.
								</p>
								<p>The software I would need to create my app would be some software development tools such as Xcode for iOS and Android studio for Android, version control software such as Github to assist in group work when developing the app and updates, photo and video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop to create professional photos and videos of the recipes and possibly cloud storage for all the content being put onto the app. The hardware I would require would be a computer to design the app, an iPhone and Android phone to test the app, possibly a NAS (Network-attached storage) if that was a more viable option opposed to purchasing cloud storage online, and a camera to shoot the photos and videos for the recipes.</p>
								<p>If the project was successful, it would have the opportunity to significantly cut food wastage in households, this would assist in cutting peoples grocery expenses by having a platform to find recipes for ingredients in their fridge that are close to their expiry date. It also has the potential to assist farmers with demands during tough times with draughts, with over $20 billion worth of food being wasted each year in Australia, it would certainly help farmers to have that number significantly reduced (Afshariyan, 2018).</p>
